    <h1>Author: Mykyta Bazhukhin</h1>
    <p>My name is Mykyta Bazhukhin and I came from Beckman Highschool in California. I enjoy programming games, rollerblading and playing games.
        I am hoping to major in Software engineering and minor in game development. I hope to also attend to many events or clubs in RIT.
